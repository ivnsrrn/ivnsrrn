### üëã ÔΩú Oh hi! Didn't see you there

Heya! I'm Zeryu (formerly Kibble/Lunaire). I like to fiddle around with stuff that I'm not supposed to fiddle with.
I'm also dunderheaded, I'll tell you that.

„ÄΩÔ∏è  ÔΩú  What do you do for a living?
- Make Discord bots that will get deleted/deprecated later.
- Play games (such as: Genshin Impact, Minecraft, and Roblox)
- Web development

üå±  ÔΩú  What projects am I working on?
- ~~[Tranquil](https://github.com/ivnsrrn/tranquil), an upcoming music bot.~~
  - This project is currently in progress, but the repository is no longer maintained due to privacy and security issues.

- [osuAutoBot](https://github.com/ivnsrrn/osuAutoBot), some bot for the game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)
  - I am not responsible for any damages, you can compile and build the code for yourself.
  - This is not game-friendly and will result in an immediate account ban if used.
  - Please use it offline. I haven't released an executable version but I will in the future.
